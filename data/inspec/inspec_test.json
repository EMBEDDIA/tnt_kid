The conventional OFDM system provides advantages through conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free subchannels at multiple frequency bands. However, it may suffer from channel spectral nulls and heavy data rate overhead due to cyclic prefix insertion. Previously, a new OFDM framework, the precoded OFDM, has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free vector channels. In this paper, we consider the application of the precoded OFDM system to efficient scalable video transmission. We propose to enhance the precoded OFDM system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video. The more critical layers, or equivalently, the lower layers, are allocated vector channels of higher transmission quality. The channel quality is characterized by Frobenius norm metrics; based on channel estimation at the receiver. The channel allocation information is fed back periodically to the transmitter through a control channel.

However, for those sites that have been maintained with hypertext markup language (HTML), considerable time and manpower costs will be incurred to rebuild them with WML. In this paper, we propose an intelligent WAP site management system to cope with these problems. With the help of the intelligent management system, the original contents of HTML Web sites can be automatically translated to proper WAP content in an efficient way. As a consequence, the costs associated with maintaining WAP sites could be significantly reduced. The management system also allows the system manager to define the relevance of numerals and keywords for removing unimportant or meaningless contents. The original contents will be reduced and reorganized to fit the size of mobile phone screens, thus reducing the communication cost and enhancing readability.

Analysis of the state-space shows that the network learns generalized abstract structures of the input and is not simply memorizing the input strings. These representations are context sensitive, hierarchical, and based on the state variable of the finite-state machines that the neural network has learned. Generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from the spatial nature of the internal representations used by the network, allowing new symbol sets to be encoded close to symbol sets that have already been learned in the hidden unit space of the network.

Pedestrians are modeled as cellular automata and compete to escape via a known exit at the soonest possible time. A pedestrian could move forward, backward, left or right within each iteration time depending on adjacent cell vacancy and in accordance with simple rules that determine the compulsion to move and physical capability relative to his neighbors. The arching signatures of jamming were observed and the pedestrians exited in bursts of various sizes. Power-law behavior is found in the burst-size frequency distribution for exit widths w greater than one cell dimension (w > 1). The slope of the power-law curve varies with w from -1.3092 (w = 2) to -1.0720 (w = 20). Streaming which is a diffusive behavior, arises in large burst sizes and is more likely in a single-exit room with w = 1 and leads to a counterintuitive result wherein an average exit throughput Q is obtained that is higher than with w = 2, 3, or 4. For a two-exit room (w = 1), Q is not greater than twice the yield of a single-exit room. If the doors are not separated far enough (< 4w), Q becomes even significantly less due to a collective slow-down that emerges among pedestrians crossing in each other's path (disruptive interference effect).

The nonexistence of stationarity called for the application of recurrence quantification analysis as a tool for this analysis, and is based on the definition of several parameters that allow for the quantification of recurrence plots. The method was checked using the European Monetary System currency exchanges. The results show, as expected, the high correlation between the currencies that are part of the Euro, but also a strong correlation between the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar and the British Pound.

The multilane domain is considered as a two-dimensional space and the interaction among vehicles in the domain is described by a dispersion model. The reason we consider a multilane domain as a two-dimensional space is that the driving behavior of road users may not be restricted by lanes, especially motorcyclists. The dispersion model, which is a nonlinear Poisson equation, is derived from the car-following theory and the equilibrium assumption. Under the concept that all kinds of users share the finite section, the density is distributed on a road by the dispersion model. In addition, the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined by the systematic gas-kinetic model derived from the Boltzmann equation. Multiplying Boltzmann equation by the zeroth, first- and second-order moment functions, integrating both side of the equation and using chain rules, we can derive continuity, motion and variance equation, respectively. However, the second-order moment function, which is the square of the individual velocity, is employed by previous researches does not have physical meaning in traffic flow", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "car-following theory;vehicular boltzmann equation;motion equation;traffic dispersion model;poisson equation;multilane traffic model;self-consistent multiclass dynamic traffic flow modeling;nonlinear poisson equation;road users;dynamic evolution;variance equation"}

There is a lack of historical perspective on industry related Web marketing applications and this paper attempts to resolve this with a two-year follow-up case study of the changing use of the Web to develop different types of relationships. Specifically, the aims are: (1) to identify key changes in the way hotels are using the Web; (2) to look for evidence of the adoption of a relationship marketing (RM) model as a strategy for the development of hotel Web sites and the use of new technologies; and, (3) To investigate the use of multimedia in hotel Web sites. The development and strategic exploitation of the Internet has transformed the basis of marketing. Using the evidence from a Web content survey this study reveals the way relationships are being created and managed within the hotel industry by its use of the Web as a marketing tool. The authors have collected evidence by means of a descriptive study on the way hotels build and create relationships with their Web presence delivering multimedia information as well as channel and interactive means of communication. In addition a strategic framework is offered as the means to describe the mechanism and orientation of Web based marketing by hotels. The study utilizes a model by Gilbert (1996) as a means of developing a measurement instrument to allow a content analysis of the current approach by hotels to the development of Web sites.

Businesses that pioneered Internet usage relied on it as a sales and marketing alternative to predecessor product distribution channels. As such, Web sites replace the traditional trading model to the Internet. Web-enabled companies are popular because the medium renders the process faster, less costly, highly reliable, and secure. Auction-based models impact business models by converting the price setting mechanism from supplier-centric to market-centric and transforming the trading model from \"one to many\" to \"many to many.\" Historically, pricing was based on the cost of production plus a margin of profit. Traditionally, as products and services move through the supply chain, from the producer to the consumer, various intermediaries added their share of profit to the price. As Internet based mediums of distribution become more prevalent, traditional pricing models are being supplanted with dynamic pricing. A dynamic pricing model represents a flexible system that changes prices not only from product to product, but also from customer to customer and transaction to transaction. Many industry leaders are skeptical of the long run impact of online auctions on lodging industry profit margins, despite the fact pricing theory suggests that an increase in the flow of information results in efficient market pricing.

In order to facilitate the implementation and improve the codec's performance, some relative issues are thoroughly discussed, such as the optimization of program structure to speed up the wavelet decomposition. SPIHT's high memory requirement is a major drawback for hardware implementation. In this paper, we modify the original SPIHT algorithm by presenting two new concepts-number of error bits and absolute zerotree. Consequently, the memory cost is significantly reduced.

Joint use of space and scale consistency is applied for better preservation of edges. The shrinkage functions are combined to preserve edges that appear simultaneously at several resolutions, and geometric constraints are applied to preserve edges that are not isolated.

We describe a new multilayered representation technique for images. An image is parsed into a superposition of coherent layers: piecewise smooth regions layer, textures layer, etc. The multilayered decomposition algorithm consists in a cascade of compressions applied successively to the image itself and to the residuals that resulted from the previous compressions. During each iteration of the algorithm, we code the residual part in a lossy way: we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part, which results in a sparse representation. Each layer is encoded independently with a different transform, or basis, at a different bitrate, and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way. The strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others: some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data, while others will catch the local transients, or the oscillatory patterns. This multilayered representation has a lot of beautiful applications in image understanding, and image and video coding.

A priori knowledge about geometrical characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the chance of any pixel being on an edge. An improved double thresholding technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering. Probabilities that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel similarity across gradient amplitudes, gradient phases and edge connectivity. The scale-space approach uses dynamic range compression to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales. A probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image which has the advantages of both spatial and scale-space domain methods. Decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail and approximation images regardless of scale. These matched filters permit significant reduction in image noise without contributing to edge distortion.

We show that this is possible provided p does not exceed a critical value p/sub c/ and calculate the critical capacity alpha c=p/sub c//N. The critical capacity depends on the range of concentrations in which the discrimination is to be accomplished. If the olfactory bulb may be thought of as a collection of such processing elements, each responsible for the discrimination of a single odorant, our study provides a quantitative analysis of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb.

The coding process assigns disjoint segments of the bitstream to the different objects, which can be independently accessed and reconstructed at any up-to-lossless quality. Two fully 3-D coding strategies are considered: embedded zerotree coding (EZW-3D) and multidimensional layered zero coding (MLZC), both generalized for region of interest (ROI)-based processing. In order to avoid artifacts along region boundaries, some extra coefficients must be encoded for each object. This gives rise to an overheading of the bitstream with respect to the case where the volume is encoded as a whole. The amount of such extra information depends on both the filter length and the decomposition depth. The system is characterized on a set of head magnetic resonance images.

An overview of existing self-synchronizing schemes is then presented. Theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark, invariant properties of transforms, template insertion, or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions. Thereafter, a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented. We propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points. Three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector. The embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a Delaunay tessellation on the set of points. The mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation. The detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles.

The algorithms chosen for close study include two gray world methods, a limiting case of a version of the Retinex method, a number of variants of Forsyth's (1990) gamut-mapping method, Cardei et al.'s (2000) neural net method, and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method (Finlayson et al. 1997, 2001; Hubel and Finlayson 2000) .

The first metric proposed is a pixel by pixel metric which introduces a local distance map between two images. The second metric associates, to a pair of images, a global value.

Many researchers have developed schemes for interactive mesh cutting with the goals of reducing the number of new primitives created, creating new primitives with good aspect ratios, avoiding a disconnected mesh structure between primitives in the cut path, and representing the path traversed by the tool as accurately as possible.

Often, different possibly conflicting criteria need to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best trade-off between uncertainty (variance) and location accuracy. The optimal set of scales depends on several factors: the noise level present in the image material, the prior distribution of the different types of segments, the class-conditional distributions associated with each type of segment as well as the actual size of the (connected) segments. We analyse, theoretically and through experiments, the possibility of using the overall and class-conditional error rates as criteria for selecting the optimal sampling of the linear and morphological scale spaces. It is shown that the overall error rate is optimized by taking the prior class distribution in the image material into account. However, a uniform (ignorant) prior distribution ensures constant class-conditional error rates. Consequently, we advocate for a uniform prior class distribution when an uncommitted, scale-invariant segmentation approach is desired. Experiments with a neural net classifier developed for segmentation of dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) images, acquired with a paramagnetic tracer, support the theoretical results. Furthermore, the experiments show that the addition of spatial features to the classifier, extracted from the linear or morphological scale spaces, improves the segmentation result compared to a signal-driven approach based solely on the dynamic MR signal.

The results indicate that the error observed for the estimation of Gaussian and mean curvatures is quite low after only one iteration. Furthermore, as the surface is smoothed iteratively, the error is further reduced. The results also show that the estimation error of Gaussian curvature is less than that of mean curvature. Our experiments demonstrate that estimation of smoothed surface curvatures are very accurate and not affected by the arbitrary direction of the first geodesic line when constructing semigeodesic coordinates. Our technique is independent of the underlying triangulation and is also more efficient than volumetric diffusion techniques since 2-D rather than 3-D convolutions are employed.

One such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array (LCOPA). An LCOPA can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light. However, when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system, two adverse effects can occur. First, dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles, causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane. Second, the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order, but to others as well. This multiple-order effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane. We describe a digital image restoration technique designed to overcome these degradations. The proposed postprocessing technique is based on a Wiener deconvolution filter.

While the masks with periodic apertures investigated in the literature are limited only to far-field diffraction, they do not take the shift of apertures within the mask into consideration. Therefore the derivation of the far-field diffraction for a single aperture cannot be applied to a mask with periodic apertures. The far-field diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed in the past, the analysis remains too complicated to offer some practical guidance for mask design. We study a circular mask with periodic rectangular apertures and develop an easier way to interpret it. First, the near-field diffraction intensity of a circular aperture is calculated by means of Lommel's function. Then the convolution of the circular mask diffraction with periodic rectangular apertures is put together, and we can present a simple mathematical tool to analyze the mask properties including the intensity distribution, blurring aberration, and the criterion of defining the far- or near-field diffraction.

The approach is useful first as a power-assist that enables a user to quickly modify many images by editing just a few, and second as a means for constructing and editing image-based scene representations by manipulating a set of photographs. The approach works by extending operations like image painting, scissoring, and morphing so that they alter a scene's plenoptic function in a physically-consistent way, thereby affecting scene appearance from all viewpoints simultaneously.

The equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters. A set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow, and from these parameters the calibration can be determined. However, as for discrete motion, in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components. Geometrically, the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component, and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation. In general, for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary, with the 3D rotation changing between the measurements. The geometric analysis gives rise to a direct self-calibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements. New constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives, and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated. The calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields.

I take as a working hypothesis the radical proposition that the heart of Management Science itself is not the impressive array of tools that have been built up over the years (optimization, simulation, decision analysis, queuing, and so on) but rather the art of reasoning logically with formal models. I believe it is necessary with this group of students to teach basic modeling skills, and in fact it is only when such students have these basic skills as a foundation that they are prepared to acquire the more sophisticated skills needed to employ Management Science. In this paper I present a hierarchy of modeling skills, from numeracy skills through sophisticated Management Science skills, as a framework within which to plan courses for the occasional practitioner", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "formal models;decision analysis;numeracy skills;management science;modeling"}

The traditional model- and algorithm-based course fails to meet the needs of MBA programs and students. Poor student mathematical preparation is a reality, and is not an acceptable justification for poor teaching outcomes. Management science Ph.D.s are often poorly prepared to teach in a general management program, having more experience and interest in algorithms than management. The management science profession as a whole has focused its attention on algorithms and a narrow subset of management problems for which they are most applicable. In contrast, MBA's rarely encounter problems that are suitable for straightforward application of management science tools, living instead in a world where problems are ill-defined, data is scarce, time is short, politics is dominant, and rational \"decision makers\" are non-existent. The root cause of the profession's failure to address these issues seems to be (in Russell Ackoff's words) a habit of professional introversion that caused the profession to be uninterested in what MBA's really do on the job and how management science can help them", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "mba programs;profession;business school management science course;management science;mba students"}

Contrary to the dominant view of the literature, FBP streaking artifacts are due mostly to mismatches between FBP's simplified model of CT detector response and the physical process of signal acquisition. Artifacts on AM images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially reduces detector-model mismatches. However, metal artifacts are reduced to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in the patient, including its pose, shape, and attenuation map, are used to constrain AM's iterations.

Our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck. Three difficulties in achieving this goal are (1) nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations; (2) emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods; and (3) no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results. These problems are solved as follows: accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask. The proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan. To obtain sufficient (anatomical) information for matching, two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol. A mutual information-based algorithm was used as a registration technique. PET and CT data were obtained in seven patients. Each patient had two CT scans and one PET scan. The datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching PET to CT/sub 1/, CT/sub 1/ to CT/sub 2/, and CT/sub 2/ to PET using the full circle consistency test. It was found that using our method, consistency could be obtained of 4 mm and 1.3 degrees on average. The PET voxels used for registration were 5.15 mm, so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size. Cropping the images (removing the scanner bed from images) did not improve the consistency of the algorithm. The transmission scan, however, could potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach. In conclusion, the represented algorithm and validation technique has several features that are attractive from both theoretical and practical point of view, it is a user-independent, automatic validation technique for matching CT and PET scans of the head and neck, which gives the opportunity to compare different image enhancements", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "automatic registration method;mutual information-based algorithm;positron emission tomography scans;user-independent automatic validation technique;standard image fusion methods;radiotherapy treatment mask;errors;automatic ridged body transformations;head;anatomical information;registration technique;tumor biology;full circle consistency test;image enhancements;transmission scan;bed positions;neck;scanner bed;computerised tomography scans;patients;nonrigid motions"}

Recently, it has been shown that this feature is associated with the phenomenon of \"loss of system coordination\" (Liu, 1999). In this paper, we study a system of ordinary differential equations representing a branched biochemical system of enzyme-mediated reactions. We show that this system can become very sensitive to changes in certain maximum enzyme activities. In particular, we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses: a unique, globally-stable steady-state, large amplitude oscillations, and asymptotically unbounded solutions, with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous. It is shown that the appearance of large amplitude, stable limit cycles occurs due to a \"false\" bifurcation or canard explosion. The subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow, namely, a saddle connection. Subsequently, almost all nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination. We discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of modulating such systems", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "saturation kinetics;stable limit cycles;bifurcation;biochemical system;nonlinear dependency;saddle connection;ordinary differential equations;metabolite concentration;enzyme-mediated reactions;enzymatic reactions"}

The work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of Zimbabwe, which includes a crop production component for yields of maize, small grains and groundnuts. Only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records. Preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra-seasonal temporal correlation was negligible, but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations. This spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of 30 related variables, representing dekadly rainfall in each of the 30 wards. For each ward, log-transformed rainfall for each of the 36 dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation, which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations. A covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards. Sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad. Cross-validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well. The methodology developed is useful in situations where long-term climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation, but negligible temporal correlation", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "covariance matrix;southern africa;parameter estimation;rainfall data;rainfall records;crop production modeling;spatial correlation;simulating rainfall;multivariate normal distribution;zimbabwe"}

We derive systems for both (T/sup 0/, p/sup 0/) and (T/sup 1/, p/sup 1/) in the presence of body forces and sources. We find that body forces and sources have a nonlinear effect on the systems. We also derive a nonlinear \"Darcy law\". Our formulation includes not only the pressure gradient, but also body forces and sources, which play the role of a nonlinearity. Later, we prove the existence of weak solutions to certain boundary value problems and initial-boundary value problems associated with the resulting equations for (T/sup 0/, p/sup 0/) but in a more general mathematical setting", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "hele-shaw flows;darcy law;injection moulding;sources;boundary value problems;nonlinear systems;body forces"}

For second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line. In this paper, we make use of the above idea of moving switching line together with the reaching law approach to design a discrete output feedback sliding mode control. The main contributions of this work are such that we do not require to use system states as it makes use of only the output samples for designing the controller. and by using the moving switching line a low sensitivity system is obtained through shortening the reaching phase. Simulation results show that the fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar to that obtained using state feedback", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "discrete output feedback;fast output sampling feedback;state feedback;moving switching line;switching variable;sliding mode control;parameter variations"}

But usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation. In this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency. One system is a legacy, text-based system with cumbersome navigation (RMS); the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation (CopNet). It is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate CopNet higher than RMS, but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will. We conducted two user studies. One study examined what users thought of RMS and CopNet, and compared RMS experts' evaluations with nonexperts. We found that all users evaluated CopNet as more effective, easier to use, and easier to navigate than RMS, and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system. The second, follow-up study examined use behavior after CopNet was deployed some time later. The findings revealed that evaluations of CopNet were not associated with its use. If the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older, legacy system, why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch? We discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult, especially for those who are most adept at using the older system. Implications for system design and usability are also discussed", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "law enforcement agency;information architecture;graphical user interface;law enforcement users;copnet;rms;legacy text-based system;simplified navigation"}

Current practices on the Web bear witness to thriving collective action ranging from persuasive to confrontational, individual to collective, undertakings. Even more influential than direct calls for action is the indirect mobilizing influence of the Internet's powers of mass communication, which is boosted by an antiauthoritarian ideology on the Web. Theoretically, collective action through the otherwise socially isolating computer is possible because people rely on internalized group memberships and social identities to achieve social involvement. Empirical evidence from an online survey among environmental activists and nonactivists confirms that online action is considered an equivalent alternative to offline action by activists and nonactivists alike. However, the Internet may slightly alter the motives underlying collective action and thereby alter the nature of collective action and social movements. Perhaps more fundamental is the reverse influence that successful collective action will have on the nature and function of the Internet", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "internet;mass communication;online mobilization;politics;collective action;group memberships;world wide web;online survey;antiauthoritarian ideology;social identities;anonymity"}

Several cases of a revealed identity deception have been reported in the media.

In this case, an established community member (DF) invented a character (Nowheremom) whom he fell in love with and who was eventually killed in a tragic accident. When other members of the community eventually began to question Nowheremom's actual identity, DF admitted that he invented her. The discussion board was flooded with reactions to DF's revelation. The authors propose several explanations for the perpetration of identity deception, including psychiatric illness, identity play, and expressions of true self. They also analyze the reactions of community members and propose three related explanations (social identity, deviance, and norm violation) to account for their reactions.

It proposes a conceptual framework to help the decision maker in choosing the most appropriate methodology in the evaluation process. It also offers a new model, called GAHP, for the evaluation problem combining integer goal linear programming and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a single hybrid multiple objective multi-criteria model. A goal programming methodology, with zero-one integer variables and mixed integer constraints, is used to set goal target values against which information technology alternatives are evaluated and selected.

Through a rigorous design of terminologies and ontologies, the DIOGENE data would then serve as a basis for the development of clinical research, data mining, and lead to innovative natural language processing techniques. In parallel, Prof. Scherrer supported the development of medical image management, ranging from a distributed picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) to molecular imaging of protein electrophoreses. Recognizing the need for improving the quality and trustworthiness of medical information of the Web, Prof. Scherrer created the Health-On-the Net (HON) foundation.

Time has seemingly borne out this hypothesis as the bureaucratic structure evolved to the matrix to the network and now to the emerging shadow structure.

Algorithms for space-time modulation of the controlled-layer structure are studied in detail for a one-dimensional boundary-value problem. These algorithms do not require wave-field measurements, which eliminates the self-excitation problem that is characteristic of active systems. The majority of the considered algorithms of parametric control transform the low-frequency incident wave to high-frequency waves of the technological band for which the waveguiding medium inside the layer is assumed to be opaque (absorbing). The efficient use conditions are found for all the algorithms. It is shown that the absorbing layer can be as thin as desired with respect to the minimum spatial scale of the incident wave and ensures efficient absorption in a wide frequency interval (starting from zero frequency) that is bounded from above only by a finite space-time resolution of the parameter-control operations. The structure of a three-dimensional parametric \"'black\" coating whose efficiency is independent of the angle of incidence of an incoming wave is developed on the basis of the studied one-dimensional problems.

Several experiments were conducted to study the error pattern, which was found to change significantly with variation in operating conditions. This model attempts to classify the error based on operating conditions. Once classified, the error is then predicted based on the temperature states.

The remote step complexity is the maximal number of steps performed by a process where a wait is counted as one step. The system response time is the time interval between subsequent entries to the critical section, where one time unit is the minimal interval in which every active process performs at least one step. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N log n), where N is the range of process names.

Then, when a disc is loaded for access, users that need data on the disc can concurrently access the disc, while users that need data on a different disc have to wait until the current disc is unloaded. The design issues for group mutual exclusion have been modeled as the Congenial Talking Philosophers problem, and solutions for shared memory models have been proposed (Y.-J. Young, 2000; P. Keane and M. Moir, 1999). As in ordinary mutual exclusion and many other problems in distributed systems, however, techniques developed for shared memory do not necessarily apply to message passing (and vice versa). We investigate solutions for Congenial Talking Philosophers in computer networks where processes communicate by asynchronous message passing. We first present a solution that is a straightforward adaptation from G. Ricart and A.K. Agrawala's (1981) algorithm for ordinary mutual exclusion. Then we show that the simple modification suffers a severe performance degradation that could cause the system to behave as though only one process of a group can be in the critical section at a time.

In this way, the rule-base structure is inherited and updated when new informative data become available, rather than being completely retrained. The adaptive nature of these evolving rule-based models, in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules, makes them a promising candidate for modeling and control of complex processes, competitive to neural networks.

The method utilizes a simple encoding scheme which can represent both compounds and variables used to construct a QSAR/QSPR model. A genetic algorithm is then utilized to simultaneously optimize the encoded variables that include both descriptors and compound subsets. The GAS method generates multiple models each applying to a subset of the compounds. Typically the subsets represent clusters with different chemotypes. Also a procedure based on molecular similarity is presented to determine which model should be applied to a given test set compound. The variable selection method implemented in GAS has been tested and compared using the Selwood data set (n = 31 compounds; nu = 53 descriptors). The results showed that the method is comparable to other published methods. The subset selection method implemented in GAS has been first tested using an artificial data set (n = 100 points; nu = 1 descriptor) to examine its ability to subset data points and second applied to analyze the XLOGP data set (n = 1831 compounds; nu = 126 descriptors). The method is able to correctly identify artificial data points belonging to various subsets.

Fuzzy automata are generalizations of classical automata where the knowledge about the system's next state is vague or uncertain. It is worth noting that like classical automata, fuzzy automata can only process strings of input symbols. Therefore, such fuzzy automata are still (abstract) devices for computing with values, although a certain vagueness or uncertainty are involved in the process of computation. We introduce a new kind of fuzzy automata whose inputs are instead strings of fuzzy subsets of the input alphabet. These new fuzzy automata may serve as formal models of computing with words. We establish an extension principle from computing with values to computing with words. This principle indicates that computing with words can be implemented with computing with values with the price of a big amount of extra computations", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "pushdown automata;fuzzy automata;fuzzy subsets;input alphabet;extension principle;formal model;computing with words"}

{"name": "test_271", "title": "On the use of neural network ensembles in QSAR and QSPR", "abstract": "Despite their growing popularity among neural network practitioners, ensemble methods have not been widely adopted in structure-activity and structure-property correlation. Neural networks are inherently unstable, in that small changes in the training set and/or training parameters can lead to large changes in their generalization performance. Recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models, ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors. In this work, we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, as applied to QSAR and QSPR. Although aggregation does offer definitive advantages, we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results. These findings are rationalized using Krogh and Vedelsby's (1995) decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them. For networks that are designed to resist over-fitting, the benefits of aggregation are clear but not overwhelming", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "uncertainty;structure-activity correlation;neural network ensembles;generalization performance;qsar;generalization error decomposition;bootstrap aggregation;retraining;training parameters;training set;bagging;structure-property correlation;qspr"}

MP employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative molecules can be selected. In each of n subsequent steps, a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of 2/sup n/ partitions are obtained.

To compare properties across different data sets, a common scale must be defined. Using several publicly available databases (ACD, CMC, MDDR, and NCI) as a basis, we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors. These chemically derived scaling functions have several advantages. First, it is possible to define chemically relevant scales, greatly simplifying similarity and diversity analyses across data sets. Second, this approach provides a convenient method for setting descriptor boundaries that define chemically reasonable topology spaces. For example, descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with little potential for biological activity, bioavailability, or other drug-like characteristics are easily identified as outliers.

However, good coherence between reference and error signals is essential for an effective noise reduction and should be checked first. Based on traffic noise prediction methods, wave theory, and mode coupling theory, the results of this paper enabled one to determine the potentials and limitations of ANC used to reduce such a transmission. Experimental coherence results are shown for two similar, empty rectangular rooms located on the 17th and 30th floors of a 34 floor high-rise building. The calculated results with the proposed method are generally in good agreement with the experimental results and demonstrate the usefulness of the method for predicting the coherence", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "open window;traffic noise transmission;wave theory;active noise control technology;rectangular room;mode coupling theory;high-rise buildings;traffic noise prediction methods;sound pressure;low-frequency components"}

This technique is illustrated by an experiment that tested the effects of advice on performance in the classic probability-learning paradigm. Previous research reported that people tested via the Web or in the lab tended to match the probabilities of their responses to the probabilities that those responses would be reinforced. The optimal strategy, however, is to consistently choose the more frequent event; probability matching produces suboptimal performance. We investigated manipulations we reasoned should improve performance. A horse race scenario in which participants predicted the winner in each of a series of races between two horses was compared with an abstract scenario used previously. Ten groups of learners received different amounts of advice, including all combinations of (1) explicit instructions concerning the optimal strategy, (2) explicit instructions concerning a monetary sum to maximize, and (3) accurate information concerning the probabilities of events. The results showed minimal effects of horse race versus abstract scenario. Both advice concerning the optimal strategy and probability information contributed significantly to performance in the task.

During a computerized version of SERT practice, students read texts and typed self-explanations into a computer after each sentence. The use of SERT strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self-explanations. This assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and LSA. Both human judgments and LSA were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with SERT tended to paraphrase the text sentences, whereas students who were compliant with SERT tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context. The similarity between human judgments and LSA indicates that LSA will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a Web-based version of SERT", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "computer-based procedure;reader strategy assessment;world knowledge;human judgments;latent semantic analysis;self-explanation-reading training;elaboration;text sentence bridging;verbal protocols"}

In an attempt to, improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to log in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in experiment I and eight characters in experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to log in. For the five-character passwords, 75% were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33% with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17% were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5% with restrictions.

The problem becomes even more challenging when multiple zones are involved, such as in barrel temperature control for extruders. Often, strict closed-loop performance requirements (such as fast startup with no overshoot and maintaining tight temperature control during production) are given for such applications. When characteristics of the system are examined, it becomes clear that a commonly used proportional plus integral plus derivative (PID) controller cannot meet such performance specifications for this kind of system. The system either will overshoot or not maintain the temperature within the specified range during the production run. In order to achieve the required performance, a control strategy that utilizes techniques such as model predictive control, autotuning, and multiple parameter PID is formulated. This control strategy proves to be very effective in achieving the desired specifications, and is very robust", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "slow processes regulation;multiple parameter pid;autotuning;model predictive control;robust barrel temperature control;extruders"}

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for batch-constructing the B/sup +/-tree, the most widely used index structure in database systems. The main characteristic of our algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be placed on each B+-tree page when accessing the page. This avoids the overhead due to accessing the same page multiple times, which results from applying the B+-tree insertion algorithm repeatedly. For performance evaluation, we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the number of disk accesses. The results show that the number of disk accesses excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the number of pages belonging to the B/sup +/-tree. Considering that the relocation process is an unavoidable preprocessing step for batch-constructing of B/sup +/-trees, our algorithm requires just one disk access per B+-tree page, and therefore turns out to be optimal. We also present the performance tendency in relation with different parameter values via simulation. Finally, we show the performance enhancement effect of our algorithm, compared with the one using repeated insertions through experiments", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "b+-tree insertion algorithm;index structure;relocation process;page access;simulation;disk accesses;b+-tree batch construction;b+-tree page;algorithm performance evaluation;database bulk loading"}

Such a framework can be, for example, biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach. Second, a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully specified program to be implemented in a robot. Many choices, tuning and tests must be carried out before obtaining a robust system. A biological model is presented, based on the definition of cortex-like automata, representing elementary functions in the perceptive, motor or associative domain. These automata are connected in a network whose architecture, functioning and learning rules are described in a cortical framework. Second, the computational model derived from that biological model is specified. The way units exchange and compute variables through links is explained, with reference to corresponding biological elements. It is then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some internal drives.

The algorithm is based on two independent artificial neural networks (ANN/sub insp/ and ANN/sub expi/) that recognize, in the original signal, windows of interest where the onset of inspiration and expiration occurs. Postprocessing consists in finding inside each of these windows of interest minimum and maximum corresponding to each inspiration and expiration. The ANN/sub insp/ and ANN/sub expi/ correctly determine respectively 98.0% and 98.7% of the desired windows, when compared with 29 820 inspirations and 29 819 expirations detected by a human expert, obtained from three entire-night recordings. Postprocessing allowed determination of inspiration and expiration onsets with a mean difference with respect to the same human expert of (mean +or- SD) 34 +or- 71 ms for inspiration and 5 +or- 46 ms for expiration. The method proved to be effective in detecting the onset of inspiration and expiration in full night continuous recordings. A comparison of five human experts performing the same classification task yielded that the automated algorithm was undifferentiable from these human experts, failing within the distribution of human expert results. Besides being applicable to adult respiratory volume data, the presented algorithm was also successfully applied to infant sleep data, consisting of uncalibrated rib cage and abdominal movement recordings.

Time-frequency analyses of normotensive and hypertensive blood flow data obtained from either the whole kidney or the single-nephron show that indeed both the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanisms have time-varying characteristics. Furthermore, we utilized the Renyi entropy to measure the complexity of blood-flow dynamics in the time-frequency plane in an effort to discern differences between normotensive and hypertensive recordings. We found a clear difference in Renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced (p < 0.037) and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations (p < 0.033), and at the single-nephron level (p < 0.008). Especially at the single-nephron level, the mean Renyi entropy is significantly larger for hypertensive than normotensive rats, suggesting more complex dynamics in the hypertensive condition. To further evaluate whether or not the separation of dynamics between normotensive and hypertensive rats is found in the prescribed frequency ranges of the myogenic and TGF mechanisms, we employed multiresolution wavelet transform. Our analysis revealed that exclusively over scale ranges corresponding to the frequency intervals of the myogenic and TGF mechanisms, the widths of the blood flow wavelet coefficients fall into disjoint sets for normotensive and hypertensive rats. The separation of the scales at the myogenic and TGF frequency ranges is distinct and obtained with 100% accuracy. However, this observation remains valid only for the whole kidney blood pressure/flow data. The results suggest that understanding of the time-varying properties of the two mechanisms is required for a complete description of renal autoregulation", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "wistar rats;time-varying properties;single-nephron renal blood flow;normotensive rats;whole kidney;spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations;single-nephron;renyi entropy;long-evans rats;hypertensive rats;renal autoregulatory mechanisms;broad-band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations;sprague-dawley rats;spontaneous oscillations"}

The particular application we have in mind is high-resolution ECG analysis, such as late potential analysis, morphology changes in QRS during arrythmias, T-wave alternants, or the study of drug effects on ventricular activation. We propose to apply a modification of a classical method of cluster analysis or vector quantization. The novelty of our approach is that we use a new distortion measure to quantify the distance of two ECG cycles, and the class-distortion measure is defined using a min-max criterion. The new class-distortion-measure is much more sensitive to outliers than the usual distortion measures using average-distance. The price of this practical advantage is that computational complexity is significantly increased. The resulting nonsmooth optimization problem is solved by an adapted version of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) method of J. Spall (IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr., vol. 37, p. 332-41, Mar. 1992). The main idea is to generate a smooth approximation by a randomization procedure. The viability of the method is demonstrated on both simulated and real data.

The DQM can quickly compute the derivative of a function at any point within its bounded domain by estimating a weighted linear sum of values of the function at a small set of points belonging to the domain. Using the DQM, the frequency-domain Telegrapher's partial differential equations for transmission lines can be discretized into a set of easily solvable algebraic equations. DQM reduces interconnects into multiport models whose port voltages and currents are related by rational formulas in the frequency domain. Although the rationalization process in DQM is comparable with the Pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) applied to transmission lines, the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different. Unlike AWE, which employs a complex moment-matching process to obtain rational approximation, the DQM requires no approximation of transcendental functions, thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching. Due to global sampling of points in the DQM approximation, it requires far fewer grid points in order to build accurate discrete models than other numerical methods do. The DQM-based time-domain model can be readily integrated in a circuit simulator like SPICE", "fulltext": "", "keywords": "interconnects;frequency-domain telegrapher pde;algebraic equations;rationalization process;multiconductor transmission lines;partial differential equations;differential quadrature method;multiport models;numerical approximation technique;time-domain model;lossy nonuniform transmission lines"}
